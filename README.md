This is a single page application featuring a map of neighborhood,I will add functionality including highlighted locations .third party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.There are number of instructions which I have to follow I am listing below,.
1.Obtain a Google Maps API key,
2.Add a full-screen map to your page using the Google Map API.
3. Write code required to display map markers identifying at least 5 locations that you are interested in whithin this neighborhood.
4.Implement a list view of set of locations you have defined.
5.Provide a filter option that uses an input field to filter both-the list view and the map markers displyed by default on load.
6.Add functionality using third-party APIs to provide information when a map marker or list view entry is clicked.
7. Be sure that all application components(i.e a search box, a list view, and the map) render on screen in a responsive manner.

 I hope these instructions will give you understanding of what is this project all about.

and again a brief overview
1.It is a single-page application using React featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood I would like to visit.I will add additional functionality to this application including map markers to identify popular locations or places you'd  like to visit. a search function to easily discover these locations, and a list view to support simple browsing of all locations.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
